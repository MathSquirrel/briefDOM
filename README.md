# Supplement to [javascript Kantor's tutorial](javascript.info)
###### *Sorted information regarding the tutorial about DOM-architecture from W3C and ES6 standarts by ~~machine learning~~.* 
#### Why

1. The tutorial only introduce you to junior-developing and you won't **know architecture** of the language. If you want to deal with JS, you for the exact address.

1. Standarts have its **unique content**, that i included here.

1. Standarts are long and boring, because there's **many references** and there is **little differents** from Kantor's textbook.

So I wrote another information about JS and DOM in view of *__brief tutorial__*. I hope that i can supplement Kantor's tutorial.
