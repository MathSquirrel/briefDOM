# Supplement to *[javascript Kantor's tutorial](javascript.info)*
###### *Sorted information regarding the tutorial about DOM-architecture from W3C and ES6 standarts by ~~artificial intelligence~~* 
### Why

1. The tutorial only introduce you to junior-developing and you won't know architecture of the language. If you want to deal with JS, you for the exact address.

1. Material of standarts has its unique content and material, that I want to include here.

1. Standarts are long and boring, because there's many references and there is little differents from Kantor's textbook.

So I wrote another information about JS and DOM in view of *__brief tutorial__*. I hope that I can supply Kantor's tutorial.
